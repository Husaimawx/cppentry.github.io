Flume NG (Next Generation) is a huge departure from Flume OG (Original Generation) in its implementation although many of the original concepts are the same. If you're already familiar with Flume, here's what you need to know.</p>
<ul style="color:rgb(51,51,51);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:20px;"><li>You still have <em>sources</em> and <em>sinks</em> and they still do the same thing. They are now connected by <em>channels</em>.</li><li>Channels are pluggable and dictate durability. Flume NG ships with an in-memory channel for fast, but non-durable event delivery and a file-based channel for durable event delivery.</li><li>There's no more logical or physical nodes. We call all physical nodes <em>agents</em> and agents can run zero or more sources and sinks.</li><li>There's no master and no ZooKeeper dependency anymore. At this time, Flume runs with a simple file-based configuration system.</li><li>Just about everything is a plugin, some end user facing, some for tool and system developers. Pluggable components include channels, sources, sinks, interceptors, sink processors, and event serializers.</li></ul><p style="color:rgb(51,51,51);font-family:Arial, sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:20px;">
目测是少了Master和ZK，多了个一个channel。</p>
